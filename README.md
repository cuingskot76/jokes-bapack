# React-Tailwind Boilerplate
This is a React.js + Vite boilerplate starter code for your portfolio or application. 

### Why i made this repo
as a newbie in React, I create a lot of new files while learning about it. when creating a React application, we have to create and configure it from scratch and it takes a lot of time. Instead of focusing on learning, I was busy installing the required dependencies.
So I'm trying to create a repo to help me and others learn React, to focus more on developing instead of installing.
